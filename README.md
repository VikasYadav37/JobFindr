```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd ai-expense-tracker
````

### 2. Setup Backend

```bash
cd backend

Create a `.env` file with your MongoDB connection:

```env
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```

Start the backend:

```bash

## 📦 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint       | Description           |
| ------ | -------------- | --------------------- |
| GET    | `/api/summary` | Get all transactions  |
| POST   | `/api/add`     | Add a new transaction |

---

## ✨ AI Categorization Logic

Categorization is done via simple keyword matching in the backend (e.g., "pizza" → food, "uber" → travel). You can modify keywords inside `backend/utils/categorize.js`.
